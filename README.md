#### Revenue by Month 
This chart displays the trend in Revenue generated each month across both business years. More revenue was generated in October as compared to the rest of the months. While there's no glaring pattern in the revenue generated by months, the stakeholders are able to keep track of how the revenue grew/decreased over time.

#### Revenue and # of Goods Sold by Countries
The company is headquartered in France while operating in 8 other countries. The sales performance across countries will provide valuable insight into which country is doing well and which requires optimized strategies to increase the revenue from that region. 

A comparison between the Revenue generated and number of goods sold shows a relationship between these two variables. Countries with high quantities of goods sold generated high revenues and vice versa. The only exception is in the case of the USA and Canada. The units sold in Canada is slightly higher than that sold in the USA but the reverse is the case for the revenue generated in these two countries.
